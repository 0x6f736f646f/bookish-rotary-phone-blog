1. **What is the name of your Tech Expo project?**

We are qualis labs and our project name was qualis vision.

2. **Why that name?**

Qualis is actually a latin word which means bora in swahili. We actually try and help improve the living starndards of people in every project we undertake.

3. **What is the project about? Kindly describe it.**

Qualis vision is project aimed at improving the quality of life of the visually impaired in society. The project employs the use of a wearable device which performs actions that a visually impaired person would have trouble engaging with. The wearable device employs the use of computer vision and artificial imntelligence to perform the following actions:

-   **Optical character recognition** – this enables the visually impaired person to read without the use of braille. Images of text are taken and an audio output is returned to the user of the text in the image.
    
-   **Emotion detection** – the device is able to recognize a group of emotions from the face of the person interacting with the visually impaired person. This utilized artificial intelligence from our trained model to detect if a person is: sad, happy, angry, surprised or neutral.
    
-   **General Image captioning(scene)** – this enables a visually impaired person to interact with the world around them. The AI model can caption various common household and office objects and relay the result of what is contained in a room to the user in audio format. The model constructs sentences form the objects to relay a coherent response to the user.

5. **What was going through your mind as you developed your project? Any challenges? If any kindly mention one or two**

As we developed the project, we had our goal of improving the quality of life of the visually impaired at the top of our minds. An issue we encountered was that as we developed our services, we kept finding that it was difficult to use the interface and we had to spend a lot of time making it easier to use. Another issue we encountered was in packaging the prototype to make it more presentable, we were however happy with how it turned out and the overall packaging.

6. **How did you perform at Tech Expo? How did the performance affect you as an individual?**

We able to get the honor of being first place in the tech expo. This was a great achievement on our part and we were pleased with it after months of work put in the project. Post the expo we are looking to improve the project further and bring it into production.

7. **Any future plans for your project?**

Yes, from the tech expo we have had increasing demand to test our product and get it to the market. It is now our core intent to come up with a fully fledged device that is industry standard which we can give  out for testing purposes

8. **Advice to those thinking about participating in Tech Expo**

To those intending to participate in the tech expo, remember that the stream beat the rock not due to strength but persistence. So in your tech expo journey, keep persisting and do not give up. In due time, you will reap the fruits of your work
