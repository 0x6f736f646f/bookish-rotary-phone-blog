1. **What is the name of your Tech Expo project?**

We are Qualis Labs and our project name was Qualis Vision.

2. **Why that name?**

Qualis is a latin word which means *bora* in swahili. We try and help improve the living standards of people in every project we undertake.

3. **What is the project about? Kindly describe it.**

Qualis Vision is project aimed at improving the quality of life of the visually impaired in society. The project employs the use of a wearable device which performs actions that a visually impaired person would have trouble engaging with. The wearable device employs the use of computer vision and artificial intelligence to perform the following actions:

-   **Optical character recognition** – this enables a visually impaired person to read without the use of braille. Images of text are taken and an audio output is returned to the user of the text in the image.
    
-   **Emotion detection** – the device is able to recognize a group of emotions from the face of the person interacting with the visually impaired person. This utilized artificial intelligence from our trained model to detect if a person is: sad, happy, angry, surprised or neutral.
    
-   **General Image captioning(scene)** – this enables a visually impaired person to interact with the world around them. The AI model can caption various common household and office objects and relay the result of what is contained in a room to the user in audio format. The model constructs sentences from the objects to relay a coherent response to the user.

4. **What inspired your idea?**

Many innovations aren't focused on the physically challenged in the society but rather on the physically abled. While we were at a friend's house, we found out that one of our friends had a cousin who got blind because of an ailment. We started brainstorming how we could help her regain her sight back. To a common person this seems rather an absurd idea. But we took up the challenge. The fact that Google has been helping people who lose voice by Neurological voice disorders gave us confidence that our journey might bear fruits. For over the start of the fourth industrial revolution, Artificial Intelligence has been a crucial research topic. Artificial Intelligence was first observed experimentally on Star Wars. So we thought we could use AI to help people regain their sight by having an assistant who could look at their surroundings and interpret.

5. **What was going through your mind as you developed your project? Any challenges? If any kindly mention one or two**

As we developed the project, we had our goal of improving the quality of life of the visually impaired at the top of our minds. One of the challenges we encountered was that as we developed our services, we kept finding that it was difficult to use the interface and we had to spend a lot of time making it easier to use. Another issue we encountered was in packaging the prototype to make it more presentable, we were however happy with how it turned out and the overall packaging.

6. **How did you perform at Tech Expo? How did the performance affect you as an individual?**

We achieved first place in the Tech Expo. This was a great achievement on our part and we were pleased with it after months of work put in the project. Post the Expo we are looking to improve the project further and bring it into production.

7. **Any future plans for your project?**

Yes, from the Tech Expo we have had increasing demand to test our product and get it to the market. It is now our core intent to come up with a fully fledged device that is industry standard which we can roll out for testing purposes.

8. **Advice to those thinking about participating in Tech Expo**

To those intending to participate in the Tech Expo, remember that the stream beat the rock not due to strength but persistence. So in your tech expo journey, keep persisting and do not give up. In due time, you will reap the fruits of your work.


**Take home**

#### 1 Ideas are great, but it is execution that matters
Have a big proponent of sharing ideas to receive initial feedback and enrich startup ecosystems. People are too afraid to share their ideas because they are afraid that valuable intellectual property will be stolen. 

#### 2 Adopting a mindset of constant trial and error
Have the spirit to constantly try new tactics to see what fits. Not having enough focus means that valuable time goes in debating the right strategy without actually trying anything. 

#### 3 Building a team culture that includes everyone
Emphasise the need for a strong company culture that created a sense of ownership, inclusion and empowerment. We believe in the mantra ‘culture is caught and not taught’.
